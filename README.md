# Cyberneom
#The app for which I seek collaboration would be called "Cyberneom".
#It is related with guided meditation, focused on the user's voice.
#Let's say your voice has a frequency of 140hz.
#For this, the initial phase must analyze the voice's audio
#and take the average to give a base frequency.
#Once the base frequency is confirmed, you can start the guiding stage in meditation
#with reference to your voice.
#This makes it much easier when meditating and improves the quality of the act.
