# Cyberneom
The app for which I seek collaboration would be called "Cyberneom".
It is related with guided meditation, focused on the user's voice.
Let's say your voice has a frequency of 140hz.
For this, the initial phase must analyze the voice's audio
and take the average to give a base frequency.
Once the base frequency is confirmed, you can start the guiding stage in meditation
with reference to your voice.
This makes it much easier when meditating and improves the quality of the act.
